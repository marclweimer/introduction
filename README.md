# introduction
First Repo


My name is Marc Weimer and I have a background international trade, global payments and transaction services.  After graduation from the University of Wisconsin, I ended up working for two of the largest US banks in Treasury and Transaction Services.  This is essentially helping large corporations with their working capital and cash management needs.

I plan to leverage new technology to help my clients tackle some of the challenges they face in a world of transition.  Financial innovation and technology has created a world of opportunity, but also unlocked new challanges for some of the world's largest companies and banking institutions.

FinTech means different things to different people.  However, the evidence in my daily work is that regardless of the organization that provides services, using new technology to analyze large sums of data, providing insights and challenging the status quo is something every financial professional needs to focus on.
